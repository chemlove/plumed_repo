Input files for biased simulations

This repository contains input files for several enhanced simulations of biomolecules.
1. receptor_activation PCV metadynamics used in the study of kinetics of activation using maximum caliber
2. dimer_US umbrella sampling simulations of dimerization, used in the multi-ensemble study of dimerization kientics
3. ligand_pose metadynamics simulations of binding pose for allosteric ligands
